# Objective
As a developer I have created a text editor that runs within the browser. This application was created with PWA criteria in mind. Application will function wether the browser is online or offline.

# Description
As mentioned, this application is a text editor that runs in the browser. The user has the ability to type a text within the editor. If the user relodes or changes browser and returns, the message remains and is stored. This application alos works offline in the browser. If the user wishes to install the application they are able to do so.

# Installation

<br>In order to install the application please run the follwoing code in Visual Studio Code.</br>

# Usage and Future Improvements
This application allows the user to have an easly accessible text editor at their fingertips. What is great about this application is that it can work offline and that it can be istalled on your device.
